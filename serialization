What is serialization ?
Process of converting object into bytestream to save object state. 
it allows to access object throught network.

how serialize in java ?
implement serializable interface which is marker interface means no members of class exist it just tells compiler 
there is something to do with this type of class
and then add serialversionUID to class which is used in serialization and deseriakzation process

can we write custom serization ?
Yes. InputObjectStream gives writeObject and readObject method othervise default jvm serialzation is used

transient ?
it is used to exclude member of class which should not be serialzied

default sewrizlation:
public class User {
// define UID
public static final serialVersionUID = 24233234L;

String username ;
String userId;
String userRole;
}
